# Strategic Protocol: Tax Resiliency & Compliance

Designed for Power Digital Media to ensure 100% financial security and regulatory compliance during rapid agency expansion.

## 🛡️ Protocol 1: Stripe Tax Automation
The platform is now engineered with `automatic_tax: { enabled: true }`. To activate this:

1.  **Dashboard Activation:** Go to [dashboard.stripe.com/tax](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax).
2.  **Define Thresholds:** Set your business location (Nexus). Stripe will automatically calculate the correct sales tax for every client based on their billing address.
3.  **Revenue Reporting:** Use the "Tax Reports" tab for 10-second data exports during tax season.

## 🛡️ Protocol 2: The "Tax Reserve" Mechanism
To ensure you always have funds for IRS/Quarterly payments, follow this high-authority payout structure:

### The 25% Reserve Rule
Every dollar that enters your account should be split immediately. 

1.  **Step 1:** In Stripe Dashboard, go to **Settings -> External Accounts**.
2.  **Step 2:** Add a second bank account (specifically a **Business Savings** or **Tax account**).
3.  **Step 3 (Manual/Automation):** 
    - **Option A (Manual):** Every Friday, look at your "Total Vol" and transfer 25% to your Reserve account.
    - **Option B (Advanced):** Use a service like **Carry** or **Found** that integrates with Stripe to auto-split tax percentages into a sub-account.

## 🛡️ Protocol 3: Record Keeping for Revenue
Stripe's **Automated Invoicing** (which we just enabled) is your primary defense. 

- **Every Session:** Generates a unique PDF invoice.
- **Client Access:** Clients can download their own invoices via the `/billing` portal, reducing your administrative load.
- **Audit Ready:** All transactions are logged with metadata (e.g., "Full Estate Architecture - Installment 1 of 4").
