# 🛡️ Power Reserve Protocol: Financial Solvency Guide

This document outlines the high-authority strategy for managing the **Power Digital Media LLC** tax reserve. Following this protocol ensures that your agency remains 100% solvent and protected against unexpected IRS liabilities. 💎🚀

## 🧪 The 30% Benchmark
Based on standard LLC tax requirements (incorporating Federal Income Tax and SE Tax), we have set your **Power Reserve** to **30%** of gross inbound revenue.

### 📊 Allocation Breakdown (Estimated)
- **Federal Income Tax**: ~15-18%
- **Self-Employment Tax**: ~12-15%
- **State Tax (MS)**: ~3-5% (Adjusted based on total annual bracket)

## 🏗️ Operational Workflow

### 1. The Payout Handshake
Every Friday, or after a major project payout hits your bank account from Stripe:
1. Check your **Power Digital Dashboard**.
2. Note the total **Power Reserve** amount.
3. Manually transfer that *exact* amount into a dedicated **High-Yield Savings Account** (HYS) labeled "TAX RESERVE."

### 2. Quarterly Rhythms 
The IRS expects estimated payments on the following schedule:
- **April 15** (Q1)
- **June 15** (Q2)
- **September 15** (Q3)
- **January 15** (Q4)

Use your accumulated **Power Reserve Vault** to pay these directly.

## 🛡️ Business Resiliency Tips
- **Never Dip into the Reserve**: Treat the tax reserve as "money that isn't yours." It belongs to the business entity's future compliance.
- **Interest Arbitrage**: By keeping your reserve in a High-Yield Savings account (like Marcus by Goldman Sachs or Wealthfront), you earn 4-5% interest on the government's money before you pay it. This becomes "Bonus Revenue" for the agency.
- **Write-Off Sync**: As you invest in new gear (mics, cameras, servers), your actual tax liability will drop. Your dashboard shows the *maximum* safe reserve. Any surplus remaining at the end of the year is your "Tax Refund" to reinvest in the agency.
